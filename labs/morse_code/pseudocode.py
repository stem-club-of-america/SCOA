There are rules to help people distinguish dots from dashes in Morse code.
The length of a dot is 1 time unit.
A dash is 3 time units.
The space between symbols (dots and dashes) of the same letter is 1 time unit.
The space between letters is 3 time units.
The space between words is 7 time units.

def setup():
    '''
    setup() -> NoneType

    Setup RPi GPIO base parameters.
    '''
    # BCM so GPIO pin numbers match

    # buzzer is an output device

    # PNP transistor - High stops flow, Low allows flow


def teardown():
    '''
    teardown() -> NoneType

    Restore RPi GPIO parameters.
    '''
    # reset RPi GPIO before exiting


def play_dot():
    '''
    play_dot() -> NoneType

    Play a morse code dot (short).

def play_dash():
    '''
    play_dash() -> NoneType

    Play a morse code dash (long).

    # A dash is 3 time units.

    # The space between symbols of the same letter is 1 time unit.
