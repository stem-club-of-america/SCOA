# Message Board
In this lab, we are building a client to interact with a server via a network
socket.  It is a very short and sweet lab to demonstrate networking concepts.
This can be completed with a Raspberry Pi or any system running Python.

This lab should be completed after going through the [Networking
Primer](./Networking_Primer.pdf) PDF.  The document takes roughly 30-45 minutes
to get through.  Additionally, there is a [Wireshark](./wireshark.pcapng) PCAP 
to demonstrate Encapsulation, DHCP, ARP, DNS, TCP, HTTP, and ICMP.  This takes
about 15 minutes to get through.  The lab to build the message board client 
should take an additional 15-20 minutes.  To allow for questions, discussions, 
and troubleshooting, you'll need roughly 1.5 hours to cover all of the 
material.
