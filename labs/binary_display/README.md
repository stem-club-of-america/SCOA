# Binary Display
In this lab, we build a display that can display 5 binary digits (0 - 31).
This lab is specifically designed to prepare students for the calculator lab
that is more drawn out and builds on lessons learned in this lab.

This lab is intended to guide the students towards figuring out the components
of the lab rather than provide to them working code.  Students are not
expected to be able to write this from scratch but provide input as we explore
the Raspberry Pi (RPi) Command Line Interface (CLI) and the python code
required to complete it.

This lab is built to continue to re-enforce the use of loops and exception
handling.  

## Difficulty
2 / 5

## Binary Display Topics
This lab was built for the GECO girls to touch on the following principles:

  * Basic Computing
    * Binary Number System
  * Basic Electronics:
    * DC circuits
  * Linux CLI commands:
    * cd
    * mkdir
    * wget
    * chmod
  * Python fundamentals:
    * for loops
    * if statements
    * RPi.GPIO
    * Lists
    * Modulus Operator
    * Exception Handling

## Hardware

  * RPi
  * Breadboard
  * 5 x 470 Ohm Resister
  * 5 x LED
  * ~ 6 Jumper wires

## Software
With the exception of this project's files, no other software is required
outside of the standard Raspian image for the RPi.
