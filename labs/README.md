## Projects
1. [Morse Code](./morse_code/)
    This Raspberry Pi project involves using a python script to generate Morse code to a buzzer connected to it.

2. [Binary Display](./binary_display/)
    This Raspberry Pi project involves combining LEDs and a python script to convert a number to Binary and light up the corresponding LEDs.

3. [Calculator](./calculator/)
    This Raspberry Pi project extends the Binary display with the addition of five push buttons to build a calculator capable of adding two 4-bit numbers and displaying them to the LEDs.

4. [Message Board](./message_board/)
    This project is a very small project that builds a socket between from client to server for posting  messages.

5. [Analog Sensors](./analog_sensors/)
    This project utilizes the MCP3002 Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to read from a temperature and light sensor.

6. [OTW CTF](./otw_ctf/)
    This project utilizes the Over the Wire server as a CTF (Capture the Flag) style exercise.

7. [GIT](./git/)
    This project demonstrates how to use git to collaborate on various projects.

8. [MAZE SOLVER](./maze_solver/)
    This project demonstrates solving an ASCII maze via a solver class.
